# Kids Playground

A collection of simple scripts to create 2D physics game, intended for giving workshops to a young audience.

## Objective

This project is intended to be as flexible as possible, not enforcing a specific game genre apart from the obvious constraints of being 2D and physics-powered. It contains a lot of scripts tha perform _atomic_ tasks, that is they do mostly only one thing, so you can combine them to create _any kind_ of gameplay.

That said, the audience should already have an idea of how Unity works, the Editor interface, the concept of GameObjects, Components, the Scene View, Play Mode, and so forth. It might be useful to guide them through these concepts before letting them play with this project.

## Usage instructions
The `/Assets` folder contains a readme file called `ScriptsExplanations.rtf` that explains what each scripts does in a one-liner. This file is intended for the kids, to give them a quick outlook of the possibities at their disposal.

The `/Sprites` and `/Particles` folders contain graphic assets which could be used to compose the scene, but kids are free to import new ones if they so desire.

Scripts are in the `/Scripts` folder, organised by category. Most of them should work out of the box, although some require objects to be tagged in a specific way to work. For instance, `/Gameplay/PlayerHealth.cs` requires the object to be tagged as "Player" in order to work, or "Player2" in the case of a 2-P game. Similarly, `/Destruction/KillEnemy.cs` will require the enemies to be tagged "Enemy".

#### User interface
The `/Prefabs` folder contains a prefab for the UI, which can be simply dragged and dropped in the scene. The scripts that communicate with the UI to show points or health will do it transparently and will still work if the UI is not present, but the UI needs to be setup so that it knows whether to show 1P or 2P UI.

## Code conventions
The following coding conventions have been used throughout the project to facilitate the usage of the script components:
- Use RequireComponent to make sure they have added the right ones
- Duplicate collision code to work with colliders (OnCollisionEnter2D) but also triggers (OnTriggerEnter2D), to accomodate any collider setup
- Check if the UI is present, to allow the components to work even in games without UI

Or the editing of the code itself:
- Loads of comments
- Leave plenty of whitespace so kids donâ€™t delete curly brackets of other functions by mistake
- Not too much caching in order to minimise code (at the expense of performance)
- Use verbose variable and method names so the kids understand what they do
